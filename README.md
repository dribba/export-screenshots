# export-screenshots
Export screenshots from chrome dev tools timeline

## Starting the app
* Clone repo
* `cd repo`
* `./activator run` to start server in port 9000 `./activator "run <port>"` if you want to run the app in a different port(I like to keep mine always running in port 9500 so it doesn't collide with my local play instance)

## How to use
* Pick a website
* Open DevTools in timeline tab
* Check screenshots(I'd recommend unchecking the rest if you don't want them, it will make the upload faster)
* From the dev tools, use `âŒ˜R` in OSX or `ctrl-R` to reload and record
* Right click on the screenshots and save the results(a `.json` extension wouldn't hurt)
* Upload and send
* Get a zip with the images
